# Battleship_2303

Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration?
If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
I think the best way is to write the tests for the output you want and work through getting that output.

If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
I would continue working on iteration 3 and definitely go back and refactor some of the code especially trying to not have my board and cells hardcoded
to allow for more flexibility
